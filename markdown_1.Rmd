**Hello** everyone! This is my first attempt to use GitHub and Git on my own. I will be making lots of changes here and this document is for my own learning only.

Here is a nice little plot, with speed against distance:

```{r, test-plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
